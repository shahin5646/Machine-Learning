# Machine Learning Prerequisites

This repository contains the essential prerequisites needed for understanding and working with Machine Learning (ML). Below is a brief description of each section and the libraries included.

## Contents

1. **01_Practices**  
   Contains examples and exercises that are aimed at reinforcing ML concepts. Updated regularly with practice materials.

2. **Datasets**  
   A collection of datasets used for ML projects and exercises. You can find different kinds of datasets for supervised and unsupervised learning here.

3. **Matplotlib_for_ML**  
   Resources and tutorials for mastering Matplotlib, a critical library for data visualization in ML.

4. **Numpy**  
   Contains tutorials and examples on how to work with Numpy, the fundamental package for numerical computations in Python, a must-have skill for ML.

5. **Pandas**  
   Resources to learn and master Pandas, the go-to library for data manipulation and analysis. This includes real-world dataset handling, cleaning, and pre-processing.

6. **ScikitLearn**  
   Scikit-Learn is the core library for implementing various ML algorithms. This section contains code snippets, examples, and tutorials on using Scikit-Learn.

7. **Seaborn**  
   Learn how to visualize complex datasets using Seaborn, which builds on Matplotlib but provides a more user-friendly API for creating informative and attractive statistical plots.
